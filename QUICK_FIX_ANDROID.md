# ðŸ”¥ QUICK FIX: Build APK for Samsung S24 Ultra

## The Problem
Metro bundler is having issues. The fastest solution is to **build an APK directly**.

## âœ… Solution: Build APK with EAS

### Step 1: Install EAS CLI
```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
```

### Step 2: Login
```bash
eas login
```
(Create account at https://expo.dev if you don't have one)

### Step 3: Configure
```bash
eas build:configure
```

### Step 4: Build APK
```bash
eas build -p android --profile preview
```

This will:
- Build your app in the cloud (takes 10-15 minutes)
- Give you a download link
- You can install the APK directly on your S24 Ultra

## ðŸš€ Alternative: Use Expo Go (If Metro Works)

1. **Make sure Expo Go is installed** on your S24 Ultra
2. **Both devices on same WiFi**
3. **In terminal, run:**
   ```bash
   npx expo start --lan
   ```
4. **Look for the IP address** in the output (like `exp://192.168.1.100:8081`)
5. **In Expo Go app**, manually enter this URL
