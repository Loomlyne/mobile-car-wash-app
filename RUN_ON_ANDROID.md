- This is very important!

### Step 3: Start the Development Server
Open Terminal and run:
```bash
cd /Users/koss/Desktop/Develop/mobile-car-wash-app-main
npx expo start
```

### Step 4: Scan QR Code

## âœ… Method 2: Build APK (For Standalone Installation)

If you want a standalone APK that doesn't need Expo Go:

### Install EAS CLI
```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
```

### Login to Expo
```bash
eas login
```
(Use your Expo account credentials)

### Configure Build
```bash
eas build:configure
```

### Build APK for Android
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

This will:
1. Build your app in the cloud
2. Give you a download link for the APK
3. Download the APK and install it on your S24 Ultra

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "App won't load on phone"

**Solution 1:** Check WiFi

```bash

**Solution:**
```bash
# Kill all processes
